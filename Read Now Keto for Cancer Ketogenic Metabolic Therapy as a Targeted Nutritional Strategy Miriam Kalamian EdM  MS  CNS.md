**Book Synopsis** : Based on the Metabolic Theory of CancerAlthough evidence supporting the benefits of ketogenic diet therapies continues to mount, there is little to guide those who wish to adopt this diet as a metabolic therapy for cancer. The Ketogenic Diet for Cancer fills this need. Inspired by the work of Dr. Thomas Seyfried and written by nutritionist Miriam Kalamian, this is the first book to lay out guidelines that specifically address the many challenges facing those with cancer.Kalamian, a leading voice in the keto movement, is driven by passion from her own experience in using the ketogenic diet for her young son. Her book addresses the nuts and bolts of adopting the diet, from deciding whether keto is the right choice, to developing a personal plan for smoothly navigating the keto lifestyle. It is invaluable for both beginners and seasoned users of the ketogenic diet as well as for health care professionals who need a toolkit to implement this targeted metabolic therapy.The book guides .
