**Book Synopsis** : Carl Cox was instrumental in the birth of dance music culture and is still the heartbeat of the global dance music scene.From warm up DJ at Paul Oakenfold's 'Future' to the opening night of the legendary 'Shoom' and unlicensed rave DJ billed as 'The People's Choice' at unlicensed raves to a global headline main stage artist playing across the world, Carl has been everything from a recording artist and producer to label owner, radio DJ and broadcaster. Oh yes, oh yes! tells the story, in his own words, of the man known as 'the three deck wizard' and the King of Ibiza; a DJ who remains at the very top of his game and continues to innovate and thrill music-lovers on the world's biggest stages.Starting off as a shelf-stacker and a scaffolder in the south London suburbs, Carl's phenomenal talents as a DJ grew out of his love of music and knowledge of soundsystem culture. In Oh yes, oh yes! he looks back over a life lived at the heart of the party, from Ibiza to Melbourne to Burning Man, .
