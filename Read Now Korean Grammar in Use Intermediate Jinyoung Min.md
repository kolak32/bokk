**Book Synopsis** : This is the second volume in the Korean Grammar in Use series which is best selling book for the learners of Korean, one of the most effective texts for learning Korean grammar. Along with the first volume, Beginning to Early Intermediate, which covered the major grammar points learned in most introductory (Levels 1 and 2) Korean courses, this Intermediate volume covers the major grammar points learned in intermediate (Levels 3 and 4) Korean courses. Together, they form a full-scale, comprehensive Korean reference grammar. Realizing that most other Korean grammar books target beginning learners only, the authors have answered the needs of intermediate level students who want a more systematic way to focus on grammar. In addition, this series serves as a general Korean reference grammar that can be used by Korean language instructors both in Korea and abroad who experience first-hand the difficulty of teaching Korean grammar. .
